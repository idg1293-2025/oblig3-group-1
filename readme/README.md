Our project's purpose was to make people more conscious about the deforestation that happens all over the world. Our Project goes under the SDG 15 "Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss." We want to bring attension to how important the forest is to out eco system.

We discussed diffrent ideas, we touched subjects like plastic in the sea, clean water and how little time we have left to fix the enviromental problems. We ended up choosing a story about a tree that grows up that looses all its fellows tree around it, with the sky becoming more and more gray. We included a slide show that have some facts about the forest taken from the UN website.

The storybords are in the same folder as this one. We strayed away from the story board beaucse it felt more natural.  but we keepd the core idea
"Tree story
Follows a tree seed growing to a adult tree
as the story continues the other trees surrounding it becomes less and less
then just as the tree we follows is about to be cut down, someone stops the machine and tells them to stop.
then a still image of people planting more trees with information about the rainforest and how important it is for the planet"

LIST OF ANIMATIONS
TRANSFORM (SUN EXPANDING)

TREE LEAVES FLUTTERINIG
ADULT TREE'S LEAVES FLUTTERING/SHAKING
CHAINSAW GOING FROM RIGHT TO LEFT
THANK YOU MESSAGE FLOATING
FADE IN AND OUT FROM THE SLIDESHOW

we have used HTML, JavaScrips, css and Scss

the used alot of eventlisters like this one "document.getElementById('evil').addEventListener('click', function () {
  this.classList.add('walk'); // Adds the animation class
});" that adds a class to a item when clicked.
we also have :
    GSAP ScrollTrigger Observers
    DOMContentLoaded Event Listeners (Ã—3)
    Click Event Observer (Evil Button)
    Click Event Observer (Slideshow Start)
    requestAnimationFrame Observer
    GSAP Implicit Animation Observers
